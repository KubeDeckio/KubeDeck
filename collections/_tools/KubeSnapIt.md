## Simplifying Kubernetes Resource Management

Kubernetes environments are dynamic, and managing resources efficiently can be challenging. **KubeSnapIt** provides a simple and automated way to take snapshots, restore resources, and compare Kubernetes states, making it easier for you to manage your cluster's configurations.

With **KubeSnapIt**, you can:
- **Take snapshots** of your Kubernetes resources to save their state.
- **Restore** resources from snapshots with ease.
- **Compare** snapshots to detect configuration changes over time.
  
## Why Use KubeSnapIt?

As your Kubernetes environments evolve, it becomes critical to manage the state of your resources effectively. **KubeSnapIt** enables you to capture snapshots, restore resources when needed, and compare states to track changes, providing peace of mind and simplifying resource management.

### Key Features of KubeSnapIt:
- **Snapshot and Restore**: Take snapshots of your resources and restore them when necessary.
- **Comparison**: Compare snapshots with each other or with the live cluster to identify changes.
- **Force Option**: Use the `-Force` option to bypass confirmation prompts during restore operations.
- **Dry Run Mode**: Simulate actions using the `-DryRun` option to see what will happen without making actual changes.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates into your existing Kubernetes workflows.

## New Features in KubeSnapIt

### Force Option for Restores
Skip confirmation prompts with the `-Force` option for quick and easy restoration:

```powershell
Invoke-KubeSnapIt -Restore -InputPath "./snapshots/your_snapshot.yaml" -Force
```

This makes restoring Kubernetes resources fast, especially for automated workflows.

### Dry Run Mode
Use the `-DryRun` option to simulate actions without making any actual changes. This is useful for verifying that your command will execute as expected:

```powershell
Invoke-KubeSnapIt -Namespace "your-namespace" -OutputPath "./snapshots" -DryRun
```

### Snapshot and Compare
Capture snapshots of your cluster's state and compare them to track changes over time or between different environments:

```powershell
Invoke-KubeSnapIt -Compare -InputPath "./snapshots/snapshot1.yaml" -ComparePath "./snapshots/snapshot2.yaml"
```
