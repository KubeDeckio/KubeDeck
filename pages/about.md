# Simplifying Kubernetes Management

**KubeDeck** was founded by **Richard Hooper** with one goal in mind: to make managing Kubernetes easier for everyone. Having worked with Kubernetes for years, Richard knew how messy **KubeConfig** files could get. So, he set out to create tools that simplify the entire process and keep everything organized.

All **KubeDeck** tools are written in PowerShell, available on the **PowerShell Gallery**, and installable via **krew**, making them easy to use and integrate into your existing setup.

## Why KubeDeck?

Kubernetes is powerful, but managing it—especially your **KubeConfig** file—can get tricky. That’s where **KubeDeck** steps in. We offer tools like **KubeTidy** to help keep your **KubeConfig** file clean and organized, and **KubeSnapIt** (coming soon) to handle snapshots with ease.

## Our Tools

- **KubeTidy**: Automatically clean up unused or outdated entries in your **KubeConfig** file, keeping it organized and free of clutter.
- **KubeSnapIt** (coming soon): Soon, you'll be able to easily create, manage, and restore snapshots of Kubernetes objects, giving you peace of mind when making changes.

These tools are built in **PowerShell** and are available on the **PowerShell Gallery**. Plus, they’re installable via **krew**, the plugin manager for `kubectl`, making setup quick and easy.

## Our Approach

At **KubeDeck**, we believe in keeping things simple:

- **Ease of Use**: Our tools are designed to be user-friendly, so you can spend less time managing your **KubeConfig** file and more time building your applications.
- **Automation**: We take the manual work out of maintaining your **KubeConfig** file and handling snapshots.
- **Efficiency**: Keeping your **KubeConfig** file clean and your clusters running smoothly is our top priority, and our tools are built with that in mind.

## Get Involved

All of our tools are open source, and we love working with the community. You can check out our tools on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubedeckio), and we welcome any feedback or contributions. If you’ve got ideas or want to help make **KubeDeck** even better, we’d love to hear from you.
